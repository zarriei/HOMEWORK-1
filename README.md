# HOMEWORK-1

##Description

This assignment was initiated and completed for the purpose of portraying "accessability," when it comes to optimizing a clients website for a better customer experience.  Also, not only are we optimizing for client side but for other coders and programmers as well.  

The original HTML file was not very ledgible or structured, which was the primary issue.
As a resolution, I structured the HTML file in a more clean and logical way by utilizing the following semantics: Header, Nav, Main, Aside, and Footer.  This makes the HTML file more ledgible as well as accessible.  

The motivation for this project was a genuine desire to better undertand how to correctly structure HTML and CSS files in a way that is more universally interpreted by others.  I believe by making things more accessible and ledgible for others, then it also makes debugging and finding errors a lot faster as well.  The quicker one can seperate a problem from a code then the faster it can be fixed.   

Furthermore, the project was intended to show how "accessability," can have great bennefits for coders and programmers.  From debugging to making code more ledgible, ease of accessability should be a goal for all projects that pertain to code or programming.
